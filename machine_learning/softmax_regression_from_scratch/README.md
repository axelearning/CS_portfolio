# Softmax Regression from scratch
---
â†³ Implement Batch Gradient Descent with early stopping for Softmax Regression (without using Scikit-Learn)

## What I Learned ?
---
- deeper understanding of gradient descent alogrithm
- understand the goal of each hyperparameters and gain insight to tune them
- learning to transform math equation to python code
- handeling matrix multiplication with numpy
- implementing different regularization algoritm
